I chose to work on Yelp Academic Dataset.

Q1.What are the types of data available to you?
1.Yelp dataset has details regarding all the businesses near universities campuses
2. The data is in json format 
3. each object is determined whether it is a business or a user or a review from its variable "type"



Q2.For data sets: how many records are in the data set?
yelp dataset has 474434 lines
wc -l yelp_academic_dataset.json



Q3.For API: what are the limits on fetching data?
Many API require authentication key to be called and only fixed number. of calls can be called per min or hour. 



Q4.Provide an "interesting" record, explain its properties and why it is interesting
{"votes": {"funny": 6277, "useful": 4698, "cool": 5325}, "user_id": "XHuNSjrPA3Vyi7n4iVhZaQ", "name": "Maria D.", "url":"http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=XHuNSjrPA3Vyi7n4iVhZaQ", "average_stars": 3.7654909437559598, "review_count": 1049, "type": "user"}

The user Id "Maria" is tagged funny, useful and cool lot of times.. apparently she has a huge fan following on Yelp itself. Her avg review starts is 3.7, which seems pretty reasonable and practical. I wanted to read her reviews and tried to search her name in Yelp ( later realised that I could have used her user Id url given in the json).
Details of Maria D : she lives in San Francisco and the funny thing I saw in her profile is that she loves "dopamine" :)
Her blog page : http://mariadiaz.tumblr.com/tagged/college
From her blog page, I found her Twitter page : https://twitter.com/mariadiaz
Her Full name :Maria Diaz

Haha, there is no privacy in this cyber world.



Q5.What are 3 questions you could answer using your data?

1. How many businesses are near UC Berkeley
2. Which business has been reviewed the most near UC Berkeley
3.Which is the best restaurant to eat near UC Berkeley( restaurant having the highest reviews near UC Berkeley)
